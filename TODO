Lifetimes:
    Files:
        - linear, growing allocator, static lifetime (for now)
    Tokens:
        - linear, growing allocator, likely dropped after parsing
    Ast:
        - linear, growing allocator, static lifetime
        - macros are registered
        - macro expressions are flagged
    Ast-Macro Processing:
        - process from the bottom
        - expand macros
        - register any macros in the result
        - flag any macro expressions in the result
    Interp:
        - runtime memory is a whole dang consideration.
            - pluggable allocators via c-interop
